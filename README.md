Intro

These examples make little sense outside of the tutorial itself.

Slides for the examples will be put up soon.


Getting Started
===============
The simpliest way to get started is to jump into share/vagrant
and "vagrant up".

The VM is basically a CentOS 6 box with golang installed and
OracleASM installed and running on it (see the
config.vm.provision "shell" section in the Vagrantfile), if
you'd like to build it yourself.
